I applied to a few colleges and chose <a href="https://www.virginia.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UVA</a> for my secondary education. My first year at UVA, I didn’t know what I wanted to focus on for my degree, so I took a wide variety of classes (drama, computer science, music, environmental science, physics, the list goes on). Over the years, I ended going for one fun major (music) and one get-a-job major (computer science). In May of 2022, I graduated UVA with 2 Bachelor of Arts degrees and then moved to northern Virginia. I worked for 2 years full time in person as a systems engineer for <a href="https://www.arcfield.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arcfield</a>, but did a lot of software engineering during my time. I sharpened my Python skills, as well as picking up some front end development tools (JavaScript, HTML, and CSS) and back end database management with SQL. I also learned the foundations of software deployment with Docker, Harbor, and Rancher for container orchestration. However, since I had lived in the state of Virginia my whole life and wanted a more advanced degree, I decided to apply to graduate school in California. I am now attending the University of California, Irvine, pursuing a Master’s in Data Science while still working remotely part time for Arcfield. </p></div>',1),f={class:"topic-container"},p=e("h1",null,[e("br"),u("Who I really am:")],-1),w=e("p",{class:"about-text"}," I’m a 25 year old guy that enjoys some pretty cookie cutter things: I like watching football (go Chiefs 3peat incoming), I enjoy spending time outdoors (hiking, camping, surfing, etc), and I love to cook just about anything. I’m currently living in Irvine, California, which is pretty conducive to the way I like to live my life with respect to the surfing and outdoorsy parts. Since my girlfriend lives in San Diego and attends USD law school, I spend a good amount of time down there as well. So far I’ve surfed at Scripps Pier, Encinitas, and Trestles Beach, which have all had awesome waves.
